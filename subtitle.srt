1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,399
Torchwood, outside the government,
beyond the police

2
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:09,364
tracking down alien life on earth,

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,179
arming the human race
against the future.

4
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:14,959
The 21st Century
is when everything changes.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,160
And you've gotta be ready.

6
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:43,599
Yes!

7
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,619
That is the last
time you choose a film.

8
00:00:51,654 --> 00:00:54,240
I was told it was good.
I feel asleep, Rhys.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,319
What does it mean, "Special Ops"?

10
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:02,639
It's no big deal. Mostly filing.

11
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:04,324
Special admin, really.

12
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,204
Can we talk about something else?
Oh, come on,

13
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,879
it's your first day tomorrow,
I'm excited for you! Big promotion.

14
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:14,400
Secondment. You'll be brilliant.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,640
Let's have an early night.
Check, please!

16
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,280
Bloody hell! Is that plane on fire?

17
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,359
It's not a plane.

18
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:39,039
We haven't paid. Come on.

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
What was that?

20
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,999
I've got to go to work.

21
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Simple locating clean up operation. Find that
meteorite before anyone else gets their hands on it.

22
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:41,680
Good to see you, by the way.

23
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:47,400
Tosh, you found it yet?
You got enough kit?

24
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,440
Basic tracking and surveillance.

25
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,124
The crash site.

26
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,179
With this we can tap into CCTV
networks, national databases.

27
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:59,200
This is the police computer system.
You shouldn't have this!

28
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:03,040
Might wanna stop saying "you"
and start saying "we".

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,040
Crash site is 100 metres ahead.

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,759
Shit.

31
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,520
The amateurs got here first.

32
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,399
All right. Usual formation.

33
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,764
What's the usual formation?

34
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,399
Varies.
How can a usual formation vary?

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,684
Who the hell are you?!

36
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,520
Sorry! This area's restricted.
No, it's all right, I'm with...

37
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:11,405
Special Ops. I'm Special Ops.

38
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,200
Torchwood. I'm with Torchwood.
Don't mess with me, little girl.

39
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,960
You're not with Torchwood.
And even if you were...

40
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:21,760
You'd have put out
the welcome banners!

41
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,564
First of all, she's no little girl.

42
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,924
All the right curves
in all the right places.

43
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,759
But she is Torchwood. We both are.
We'd appreciate it

44
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:31,320
if you'd leave us
to do the real work.

45
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,519
Shall we?

46
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:42,040
So let's see what we came for.

47
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,879
What do we know?
Bog standard space debris.

48
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:06,845
That's a technical term.
Yeah, thanks.

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,280
So take all the readings
and let's get out of here.

50
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,125
Make yourself useful, sweetheart!

51
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,284
Pass us the big chisel from the
toolbox. Not sweetheart - Gwen.

52
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,479
One syllable, sure you can manage it.
Not sweetcheeks? Freckles? New Girl?

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,759
It's a shame your tool's not
big enough for the job, darlin'.

54
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:46,279
Catch! Don't! Shit!

55
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,279
Put this on!

56
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,959
Is this all I get now,
your voicemail?

57
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,765
You're out with her, aren't you?

58
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,560
You bastard, you could've
had the decency to text.

59
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:48,964
I've been standin' in
there all on my own.

60
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,240
I'm sick of this hanging around all of the time
waiting for you to show up. I wish I'd never met you.

61
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:57,320
I wish I was dead, no,
I wish you were dead.

62
00:06:57,355 --> 00:06:59,439
Call me back.

63
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,920
Hiya. Evening, ladies.
Hiya, handsome.

64
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,359
Very nice.

65
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,845
Where do you think you're going?

66
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,079
I've been in once,
I came out to make a call.

67
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:40,839
There's no readmission.

68
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,680
Um, OK, then, on you go.

69
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,759
Watch and learn, boys.

70
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,760
I don't even know your name.

71
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:47,719
Overrated, names.

72
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,240
I don't think... I can... hold on.

73
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:13,444
Well, go on, then.

74
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:18,919
Go on... you're... this
is... the best... Oh!

75
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:44,005
I'm so sorry.
Seriously, stop saying that.

76
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,964
But I am! I mean, really,
I mean really, really sorry.

77
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:55,000
God, I can't believe it. Didn't they
teach you Health and Safety in the police?

78
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:57,120
You chucked tools
at each other, so...

79
00:09:57,155 --> 00:10:00,044
We didn't miss. I'll sort it.

80
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,799
Whatever's happened, I'll deal with
it. What d'you think has happened?

81
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,799
I mean, it was just gas, wasn't it?

82
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:08,765
That can't be too bad, can it?

83
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,165
Right, because gas never
did anyone any harm

84
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,719
On the plus side, we've got good
evidence, relatively undamaged.

85
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:18,644
On the downside,
there's an alien on the loose,

86
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,859
we don't know where it is, why
it's here or what it's going to do.

87
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:25,004
Give her a break! God, this has
been the worst first day ever.

88
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,600
We all make mistakes. Now we find and
recover whatever came out of there.

89
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:34,639
This might help. Nightclub death
been phoned into 999.

90
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:39,599
Circumstances sound...
a little unusual.

91
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,799
Might be connected.

92
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,359
Torchwood.

93
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,565
Gwen? Hi!

94
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,239
Bloody hell! Look at you, all posh.

95
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:13,879
Special ops! We were wondering.

96
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,205
I meant to call.

97
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,880
It's been a bit of a whirlwind.
Go on, then, tell us all. Coming?

98
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:21,445
Yeah, sorry.

99
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,640
You can get away now. No point you
freezing your arse off out here.

100
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,400
Boss of me now, are you?

101
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,639
Say hi to everyone for me.

102
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,244
This is all that's left?

103
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,000
How's that possible? The question is
how did you know this used to be a body?

104
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,639
Go on, son! With you all the way!

105
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:02,659
Bit of a shock, I tell you.

106
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:05,839
We need to see that CCTV.

107
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,039
Wow. Oh, my God!
He just... Came and went.

108
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,724
That's the way I'd like to go.

109
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,319
I'm sure we could arrange it.
How can that be?

110
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:24,764
It doesn't make any sense.

111
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,039
It's not possible.
Do you know the girl's name?

112
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:31,244
Did they arrive together
or meet in the club?

113
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,200
Is she a regular? Would any of the
other staff know her? I dunno!

114
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,759
We get hundreds of people
here every weekend.

115
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:41,080
I don't keep tabs.
Thanks for your help.

116
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,360
We've got all we need.

117
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,399
What are you talking about? We haven't
got a clue. We don't even know her name!

118
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:53,284
We need a body from the cryo-chamber,
close match for the dead guy.

119
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:57,760
Disfigure the face, dump it someplace
remote, make it look like a suicide attempt.

120
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:59,160
You have a stash of bodies?

121
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,365
What about his family?

122
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,479
You can't just fake his death.
You want to tell his family

123
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:12,319
he died screwing an alien?
We don't know for sure.

124
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:14,604
Same elements recorded
at the crash site.

125
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
Traces all over the club
but strongest in this area.

126
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,080
Something happened here.

127
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,565
It's my fault.

128
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,980
If it weren't for me,
he'd still be alive.

129
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:43,360
That'll get you nowhere,
that thinking.

130
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:45,437
At least now we know a little more.

131
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:47,479
The alien's taken on a host body.

132
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:50,400
We can't let her kill again.

133
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,480
I said to them, you're putting yourselves
out of work, behaving like this.

134
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:08,599
I can get five Polish lads
who don't take any breaks,

135
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:12,125
happy as sand boys,
all for 56 quid above board.

136
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,759
I told Niall, I said, "Why should I bother
with your moaning mates when I can get this?"

137
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:20,760
Carys? Dad?

138
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,444
Hangover from hell, is it?

139
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,759
What did you get up to last night?

140
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:28,040
I can't really remember.

141
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,599
Mullered, I was.

142
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,440
Gotta go.

143
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,560
Tony needs the van by nine.

144
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,839
You in tonight?

145
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,959
What's this supposed to do?
I'm using satellite-tracking data

146
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,076
to determine the inward trajectory
of the meteorite.

147
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:01,124
He means he's trying to find
out where it's came from.

148
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,719
Sometimes techno babble is good for
the soul. So this is a route planner.

149
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,325
Not far off.

150
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,080
Rhys, my boyfriend, is a transport
manager. He does this sort of stuff.

151
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:13,519
On a slightly smaller scale, though.
You have a boyfriend?

152
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:17,080
Yeah. Have you?
Don't have time with this job.

153
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,159
What about you? You seeing anyone?
You've gotta be joking.

154
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:24,760
I can get all the grief I need here.

155
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:26,160
None of you have partners?

156
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:28,040
Just you, newbie.

157
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:34,959
I'm not being rude or anything...
Well, maybe I am, but...

158
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:37,720
how do you
switch off from all this stuff?

159
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,840
What do you do to relax?

160
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,160
I torture people
in happy relationships.

161
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,404
Gas traces confirmed
as Vorax and Suranium.

162
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:11,640
My two favourite gases. Can we do a check,
and find out what we know about them?

163
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:13,804
I'm all over it. What's this doing?

164
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,559
I've taken an image of the girl from the CCTV.
This cross-checks her face with the UK population.

165
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,884
You can't have every
face in the UK on there.

166
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,120
That would be against
civil liberties, data protection...

167
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,560
Still doing that "you"
instead of "we" thing.

168
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:30,205
119 suspects.

169
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,564
It's supposed
to give us a single match.

170
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:37,199
The CCTV was too low res. I've tried
magnifying and augmenting but it just breaks up.

171
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:41,417
The software can't function properly.
It's narrowed the numbers down.

172
00:16:41,452 --> 00:16:45,600
I could check through the rest. The
old fashioned way - with my eyes.

173
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,560
What about the fingerprints
I took off the alley wall?

174
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,765
It was a long-shot, anyway.
Just a bit.

175
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,839
Least I'm trying to do something.
You're trying anything.

176
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:02,037
The CCTV must have picked up
her arrival at the club.

177
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:05,116
Tosh, can you reformat the
image recognition software

178
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,160
to trace her journey backwards
via street cameras?

179
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,845
It'll take a while to process.

180
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,219
Every possible turn means
thousands of probabilities.

181
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:16,524
Have a go. At least we'll
know where she started.

182
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,320
We could cross reference that
with the remaining face matches.

183
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,840
Good one, newbie!
That's a bit more like it!

184
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:30,279
Ah!

185
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,199
Ah!

186
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,999
No!

187
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,160
You're keeping our website
in business.

188
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,659
Well, your, er, dad's not in, then?

189
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,999
Get your clothes off!
Steady, Carys!

190
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,445
All right, that's enough.

191
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Joke over. Barry's
put you up to this, has he? Shut up!

192
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:35,320
What's going on?! Put your
trousers on and get out. NOW!

193
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,120
It always breaks my heart to
say those words. Air quality's OK.

194
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,879
Gwen, look out!

195
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,685
What's that?
It's a sort of inflatable cell.

196
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,764
Power runs down after an hour.
The battery life's bollocks.

197
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,324
Who said you could use that? Um,
I just stopped a prisoner escaping.

198
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,759
You know the rules. None of that stuff
leaves the building without my permission.

199
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:07,919
Fine. Don't thank me.

200
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,480
Come with us.

201
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,439
See what you can find out from her.
But aren't you going to help me?

202
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,204
I don't know what I'm doing.

203
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,640
Usually better if you don't say
that in front of the prisoner.

204
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,039
Are you MI5?

205
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,720
Where am I? What do you want?

206
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:08,965
I think you know, Carys.

207
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,839
How d'you know my name?
I've never been in trouble.

208
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:15,840
What do you want from me?

209
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,164
I know there's something
living inside you

210
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:25,479
and I know what it made
you do. His name was Matt Stevens.

211
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:30,760
His parents lost their only
child at 3:07 this morning.

212
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:34,039
Ah! Ah!

213
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,960
You broke my ship.

214
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,004
Come on then. Where are you from

215
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,760
and why are you trying to invade earth?
You can forget about enslaving us.

216
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,085
Who said anything about enslaving?

217
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,840
Well, that's what you
lot do. Aliens. Isn't it?

218
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:15,960
No, I just want the energy.

219
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:17,519
The climax.

220
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,039
I live off that energy.

221
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,364
Right, sorry, just to recap.

222
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,120
You've travelled here
to feed off orgasmic energy?

223
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:31,680
There's nothing else
out there like it.

224
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,644
You taste so good.

225
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,919
You're the best hit there is.
Ah! Ah! No!

226
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,284
Help me

227
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,279
Please, get it out of me.

228
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,800
Carys?

229
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,924
Hel-lo.

230
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,600
Happy birthday, me.

231
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,520
OK, first contact with an alien.

232
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,479
Not quite what I expected.

233
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,960
Oi, you lot... treat!

234
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,204
Whoa. Wow.

235
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,845
She said she had a boyfriend.

236
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
You people and your
quaint little categories.

237
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,920
We should really
get her out of there.

238
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah. I mean, yeah! Come on!

239
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,000
Just... record a bit first.

240
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,560
No! It's no good.

241
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,719
It's got to be a man.

242
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,000
Ah! Oh!

243
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:21,085
I'm losing.

244
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,399
Promise me you'll help me.

245
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:26,479
Promise me.

246
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,839
I promise.

247
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,085
Hi.

248
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,205
You're not still at work? 'Fraid so.

249
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,685
'What time will you be done?'
Not sure when I'll be finished.

250
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,760
Is it exciting, though, have you
had loads of excitement? Erm, some.

251
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:58,840
Er sorry, yeah, is now a good time?

252
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,605
Em, maybe not the best.

253
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,480
Oh, pity me,
I'm a Special Ops widow.

254
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,719
I'll call you later.

255
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:06,880
'Bye. '

256
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,000
Way to go, newbie! That is what
I call a methodical investigation.

257
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:45,679
I can't wait to see
you take down her particulars.

258
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:48,844
What are you doing?! Get off me!

259
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:53,039
That girl's body is being overrun by I
don't know what. And you think it's a joke?

260
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,999
All right! Jesus! I'm sorry.
We should be helping her.

261
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:58,399
She's not some lab rat.
No, she's a murderer.

262
00:24:58,434 --> 00:25:00,856
You were the one
who wanted her caught.

263
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:03,244
How come suddenly
she's your best friend?

264
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,480
You know, strictly speaking,
throttling the staff is my job.

265
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,640
So who's for Chinese?

266
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,445
And she said...

267
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:18,560
"If I'd known that's what he was,
I never would have married him!"

268
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:22,960
She knew all along!
She didn't care.

269
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,925
Until he started leaving black piles
of mucus in the bathtub.

270
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,439
Always the big giveaway. Aliens
have no sense of household hygiene.

271
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:39,799
Which reminds me, gotta pee.

272
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,205
So what's he told you? What about?

273
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,420
Himself! You've been here longer
than I have. We were banking on you!

274
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:53,227
You're a copper, trained to ask
questions. You don't know anything?

275
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:57,000
Not who he is, not where he's from.
Nothing, except him being gay.

276
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:59,680
No, he's not. Really, do you think?

277
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,597
Owen does. I don't.

278
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:03,445
And I don't care.

279
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,000
Period military is not the
dress code of a straight man.

280
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:09,565
I think it suits him.
Sort of classic.

281
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,680
Exactly! I've watched him in action. He'll
shag anything if it's gorgeous enough.

282
00:26:14,715 --> 00:26:17,965
We know he's from America, right?
We don't know that for sure.

283
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,159
No US citizen by the name of Jack
Harkness born in the last 50 years.

284
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:24,164
Maybe his identity's classified.

285
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:28,199
Used to be something big in the CIA.
That's what I reckon.

286
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:31,737
He must have his reasons for
wanting to keep things secret.

287
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:35,240
Sure he has. Doesn't stop me
wanting to know what they are.

288
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,680
What's that sound?

289
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,925
What are we doing having Chinese
while a girl fights for her life?

290
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,799
Actually, while we've been eating, the computers
have been running a full bio-scan on Carys,

291
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,804
profiling her blood, metabolism,
organs, skin, the works.

292
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,324
So we can see what effect the alien's
having on her. They've also been

293
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,839
taking samples of the air in the cell so we can
analyse changes in the environment around her.

294
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:24,400
Now, is that enough,
do you want more?

295
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,765
Cos it gets kinda boring.

296
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,524
You've been hidden down here
too long.

297
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,039
Spending so much time with the alien stuff,
you've lost what it means to be human.

298
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,440
So remind us.

299
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,119
Tell me what it means to be
human in the 21st century.

300
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:44,959
All right.

301
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,964
Carys Fletcher,
born 13th November, 1987.

302
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:25,925
School reports, personnel files
from her temping agency,

303
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,645
swimming badges, reports of
her mother's death in a car crash.

304
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,605
And emails discussing the merits
of Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger.

305
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,299
Why have you done this? This isn't about
meteorites or gases. We have a trapped girl

306
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:46,959
and we have to save her. When I was with her
in the cell, Carys told me she was losing.

307
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:50,319
We have to find a way
to keep her fighting,

308
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,080
remind her to hold on to who she is.

309
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Have I got something on my face?

310
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,400
No.

311
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,160
Just, it's... brilliant.

312
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:08,840
You are brilliant.

313
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Thank you.

314
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,284
So we should bring in her dad.

315
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,919
You're kidding. We've got to find
something to connect with her.

316
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:22,537
Make her fight back. Our priority
is to contain the alien threat.

317
00:29:22,572 --> 00:29:26,120
Not put civilians in a cell with it.
We should be helping her.

318
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:30,240
If we don't, who will, Jack?
Are you always this awkward?

319
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:32,280
'You should take a look at this. '

320
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,959
This is the normal chemical
composition of the air in that cell.

321
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:41,484
And these are the readings
from the last hour.

322
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,644
The alien's secreting an ultra-powerful
blend of airborne pheromones.

323
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,520
Sex pheromones. 1,000 times more potent
than anything we'd normally experience.

324
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,524
She's a walking aphrodisiac!

325
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,200
I did wonder why I...
Actually, I sort of snogged her.

326
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,284
We know.

327
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,179
Now, still wanna
put her father in the cell?

328
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:06,040
God, no! We can't let any man near...
Owen!

329
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:12,439
Jack, Carys is out of her cell.

330
00:30:12,474 --> 00:30:15,045
Cheeky bitch took my swipe card!

331
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,200
'I'll deal with it. And tell Owen he
needs to work on those abs a bit harder. '

332
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:27,640
I was taking some readings, you know, keeping
an eye on her, and bang. You got away lightly.

333
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:31,880
Be thankful she was only interested in
your swipe card. Are you all right now?

334
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,880
Or are you still feeling
a bit of a cock?

335
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,360
No exit, sorry.

336
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,279
Yeah?
You want a little rough and tumble?

337
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Well, let's make it a fair fight.

338
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,639
You won't stop me.

339
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,359
Put it down! That's worthless
to anyone but me.

340
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,885
Down now! Or I'll shoot.

341
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:47,440
Says he will but the eyes say he
won't. I'm going. Don't stop me.

342
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,120
Please help me.

343
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,639
Need me to do any attacking, sir?
Appreciate the offer. Just open the door.

344
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,240
Now give me the jar.

345
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,600
NO!

346
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:25,039
After all I said, a severed hand is
more important to you than Carys' life.

347
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:27,204
You want to prove yourself?

348
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:32,840
Find her. Get your old pals in the
police to do something useful for once.

349
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,240
All right, I'll give them a call.

350
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:37,405
Put out an APB -

351
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,960
woman possessed by gas
knobbing fellas to death.

352
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:43,045
Oi! You'd better get in here!

353
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,004
So I'm trying to interpret
the results of the bio-scan.

354
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,839
Yeah, but it's just a mess, like
there's no definitive readings.

355
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:52,237
Because everything in
her body keeps changing,

356
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:54,565
nothing stays constant.
As soon as you think

357
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,680
you've got something clear, the metabolic
rate, the blood pressure all goes wild again.

358
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:02,657
She's fighting the alien
for control of her body.

359
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:05,599
So anyway, I decided to
do a comparative diagnostic.

360
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:07,684
Recreate the circumstances,

361
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:11,919
accelerate the process a little, see
what's gonna happen to Carys. Yeah, thanks.

362
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:14,884
I infected the rat with
a combination of the Vorax and

363
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,400
Suranium gas traces we found at
the crash site and the nightclub.

364
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:19,724
Looks fine so far.

365
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:24,239
Once the gases start to flow round
the body, the party really starts.

366
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:32,000
The heart rate triples. The brain
swells, pressing against the skull.

367
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:35,479
Then the lungs began to shrink,
making it impossible to breathe.

368
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:39,319
The pressure increases
on all the internal organs until...

369
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,285
Rat jam!
That's what's gonna happen to Carys?

370
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,200
"I'm losing", that's what she said
to me. Right now, it's a struggle

371
00:34:48,235 --> 00:34:52,079
between where Carys ends
and the alien begins.

372
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,604
We have to think like her.

373
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,939
Put ourselves in her place.
It's the only way to find her.

374
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:35,205
Except we don't know what
her controlling impulse is by now -

375
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,720
Carys or the alien inside. The last
thing I saw was a fight for control.

376
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:44,605
The overriding factor for the
parasite is to have sex.

377
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,125
It's a survival instinct - that's
bound to be the strongest drive.

378
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,839
All right, so you're Carys. You're desperate for
sex cos that's what the thing inside you needs,

379
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:56,520
but you know it will kill.
Where would you go?

380
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,325
I'd come round and shag you.

381
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,600
What?! It's a joke! Can't I have a
joke with my team-mates? Right now? No.

382
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:09,359
So what are we talking about?
Brothels? Lap dance clubs?

383
00:36:09,394 --> 00:36:10,999
Anywhere there's eager men?

384
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:12,160
I know what I'd do.

385
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,164
What the hell are you doing here?
You look a bit wired.

386
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,760
I had to see you. You should've
called. Bethan might've been in.

387
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:23,084
I could kill you.
I could bloody kill you!

388
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,800
What the hell was that message you left on my mobile
last night? Sounded like you were off your face.

389
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,159
If I wanted to,
I could kill you... now.

390
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:38,404
Look, I've told you.

391
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:43,480
I'm not leaving Bethan. You're a lovely
girl, but it's just not gonna happen.

392
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:46,165
You were my first, see.

393
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,719
I never told you
cos I thought you'd laugh.

394
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:52,565
And you're crap.

395
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,760
All you want is to come and
you don't care what's underneath.

396
00:36:56,795 --> 00:36:59,160
Go on, have a go.
Get it out of your system. Ah!

397
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,959
Do you love me, Eddie?

398
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,159
Did you ever love me? No.

399
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,879
You could've saved yourself.

400
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:22,279
What?

401
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,164
We're too late.

402
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,999
Tosh was right, though.
She went for the ex-boyfriend.

403
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:36,245
Lucky she's young.

404
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,079
Work your way through my back catalogue,
we'll be here till the sun explodes.

405
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:44,245
Where next? And how long before
that thing destroys her body?

406
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,280
So what's our next move. Stop the
entire city of Cardiff from shagging?

407
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:51,717
Put bromide in the water supply.
No, too hit and miss.

408
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:55,084
The water company got pissed off
last time we did that.

409
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,159
It could have used any body in Cardiff.
Why her? I just assumed it was random.

410
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,199
It's mining Carys' life to get what it
needs. What else do we know about her?

411
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:06,880
Anything you can think of?
What are you all looking at me for?

412
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:11,160
You did all the profiling!
I don't know. Sorry.

413
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:12,245
She's great under pressure.

414
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,279
There's gotta be something.
What did you say Carys' job was?

415
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:17,564
She's just a temp. Receptionist.

416
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,559
Where's she working at the moment?
I can pull her employment files up.

417
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,859
Conway Clinic. You're joking.
What's the problem?

418
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:29,045
It's a bloody fertility clinic.
Sperm donors.

419
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,840
An unlimited supply of orgasmic energy
without all the build-up. Perfect hit.

420
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,000
Ah!
Carys. You're not on today, are you?

421
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:55,000
It needs more.
The energy - it's not lasting.

422
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:56,959
Sorry?

423
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:03,799
'Mr Tunstall,
room number one's ready now. '

424
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,360
What's this for? Need a diagram?
I've never used a gun.

425
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,125
You were in the police!

426
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,160
I was on the beat! I'll
make sure you don't need to use it.

427
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,119
I'm asking for you to get out! Relax, I
can help. I don't think so, love, I'm gay.

428
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,204
What do we do if we find her?

429
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,245
How are we going to get it out of
her? Judging by the test results,

430
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,319
the gas needed a host because prolonged
exposure to our atmosphere is poisonous to it.

431
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:44,479
But our bodies are
the perfect environment.

432
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:46,444
If we isolate it
from Carys' body...

433
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,399
It won't survive for long.
Sounds like we have a plan.

434
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:50,485
Force it to die.

435
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,759
Just like it did those poor blokes.

436
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:54,999
What about Carys?
Better start praying

437
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:57,639
we get to her in time.

438
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,760
Come on!

439
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,759
Out! Now!
Get as far away as you can!

440
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,239
God, how many more?

441
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,319
In here!

442
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,680
Nowhere to run.

443
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,800
All this sex.
All we see, all we think.

444
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:56,885
So much beauty... and so much fear.

445
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,039
We want it but we're
so afraid of it... Ah!

446
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:03,404
The strain on her body's too much.

447
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:07,759
Any second now, she's rat jam.
One more and I'll be strong.

448
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:09,644
Each time, it works less.

449
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,160
Each time, the feeling's weaker.

450
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:16,719
One more. Make me feel alive.

451
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:19,560
Make me feel human.

452
00:41:19,595 --> 00:41:21,557
I can't.

453
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:23,485
I can.

454
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,280
Jack! I've got a surplus of alive.

455
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:27,565
I'm giving it away.

456
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,279
You really want to feel something?

457
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,520
What's he doing?

458
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,400
That was just the kiss. Imagine
the buzz you get from the rest.

459
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:57,159
Wasn't exactly the reaction I anticipated.
Her body won't last much longer.

460
00:41:57,194 --> 00:41:59,084
Use me.

461
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,760
Leave Carys. Take my body as host.
Just let her live.

462
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:08,644
Gwen... I'm stronger than she is.

463
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:12,360
I'll last longer. You might be
able to save me, I don't know.

464
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:15,485
OK. Jack!

465
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,159
You can't let her! Like she
said... she's responsible for this.

466
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,319
Come on, then. Do it. Leave her.

467
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,920
How long can it survive in there?

468
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:21,845
It was pretty weak. Why?

469
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,160
Bit worried how long that
battery'll last for.

470
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,520
Look... It's dying.

471
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,079
You travel halfway across the
universe for the greatest sex.

472
00:43:56,114 --> 00:43:58,840
You still end up dying alone.

473
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,359
Thank you.

474
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,284
Still here?

475
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:07,120
Everybody else is off doing... whatever
it is they do when they're not here.

476
00:45:07,155 --> 00:45:08,960
How long have you been there?

477
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,259
I wanted to finish off.

478
00:45:16,294 --> 00:45:18,644
Do one thing for me.

479
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:24,919
Don't let the job consume you. You
have a life. Perspective. We need that.

480
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:27,844
Who are you, Jack?

481
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:33,079
I'm sorry? You can't die. You tell me
the 21st century is when it all changes,

482
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:34,885
that we have to be prepared.
You do.

483
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,239
But how can you know? You think knowing
the answers would make you feel better?

484
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:43,759
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

485
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,719
Go home, Gwen Cooper. Eat lasagne.

486
00:45:48,754 --> 00:45:50,280
Kiss your boyfriend.

487
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:52,617
Be normal.

488
00:45:52,652 --> 00:45:54,920
For me.

489
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,719
So I said, those bloody website...

490
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,245
I've had years of experience.

491
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,840
I know the journeys, I've driven
most of them, I know the best way.

492
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,800
Am I boring you?

493
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,405
Sorry.

494
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,999
Too grand to care
about transport routes now, are we?

495
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:33,120
Let's go to bed.

496
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,719
You saw the echo of a moment
amplified by alien technology.

497
00:46:53,754 --> 00:46:57,205
A ghost... 40, 45 years ago.

498
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,039
I saw it happen. Ah!
You need to know how to use these.

499
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,359
